                                    The transition from secondary school students marks a crucial moment in the lives of Australian students.
                                    Critical desicions regarding their future educational and career paths are being made.
                                    Undestanding the trends that influence their choices will provide valueble insights into the 
                                    broader educational landscape. To better understand these dynamics, several visualisations are created
                                    to explore the number of tertiary education students in <span style="font-style: italic;">Australia</span>.

                                    The choropleth map above illutrates the distribution of university students per 10000 capita across various states in
                                    <span style="font-style: italic;">Australia</span>. Each state is shaded based on this ratio, allowing for a comparison
                                    of student density relative to the population size. As the map suggests, despite having only a small area of size, <span style="font-style: italic;">Australian Capital Territory</span>
                                    exhibits a high number of university students per 10000 capita, at <span style="font-weight: bold;"> 1368.88</span> unviersity students per 10000 capita. This suggests
                                    that <span style="font-style: italic;">Australian Capital Territory</span> is home to prominent institutions like the <span style="font-style: italic;">Australian National University (ANU)</span> and the <span style="font-style: italic;">University of Canberra</span>, 
                                    which attract students from across the country and internationally. On the other hand, <span style="font-style: italic;">Tasmania</span> has only <span style="font-weight: bold;"> 928.54</span> unviersity students per 10000 capita. The reason behind that 
                                    might be there are fewer higher education institutions compared to other states. The <span style="font-style: italic;"> University of Tasmania (UTAS) </span> is the main university in 
                                    the state, and while it serves the local population, Tasmania doesn't attract as many interstate or international 
                                    students.

                                        The grouped bar chart on the left shows the number of students in public and private universities in each state, providing
                                        a clear comparison of the distribution of higher education institutions across Australia. We can clearly see that 
                                        the number of students in public universities are more than the number of private institutions, showing the effort of the government
                                        in providing tertiary education for the people, making them more accesible across the country. As th results suggests
                                        we can observe that states such as <span style="font-style: italic;">New South Wales</span> and 
                                        <span style="font-style: italic;">Victoria</span> both have more stuents in public universties, at <span style="font-weight: bold;"> 114,625 </span> and 
                                        <span style="font-weight: bold;"> 113,053 </span> respectively, whereas the number of students in private institutions are way lesser. Interestingly, 
                                        for states such as <span style="font-style: italic;">Northen Territory</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Tasmania</span>
                                        do not have any private institutions provided for students, showing their lack of options when choosing to continue their studies after
                                        secondary school.

                                    The donut chart showed above provides information of the various level of study of university students in Australia in 2023. Each segment of the chart corresponds to a specific level.
                                    The 3 highlighted segments represents the 3 level of study with the highest number of students, which are
                                    <span style="font-style: italic;">Bachelor Degree</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Postgraudate Degree</span> and 
                                    <span style="font-style: italic;">Certificate III/IV</span>. For <span style="font-style: italic;">Bachelor Degree</span>, it has
                                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">815,700</span> students currently studying, the most out of all levels. Then, the number of students studying in
                                    <span style="font-style: italic;">Certificate III/IV</span> is at <span style="font-weight: bold;">510,000</span>, which is also a high amount of students compared to others.
                                    The level with the third highest number of students is the <span style="font-style: italic;">Postgraudate Degree</span>, at <span style="font-weight: bold;"> 311,500 </span>students. This suggests that
                                    there are also a lot of students who continued to pursue their studies after their Bachelor Degrees, increasing their knowledge in respective fields.

                                    The line chart above displayed the proportion of university students' <span style="font-style: italic;">main field of study</span> from year 2013 to 2023. As of
                                    2023, the main field of study that is most popular amongst students is <span style="font-style: italic;">engineering and related technologies</span>, where approxiamtely <span style="font-weight: bold;">21.2%</span>
                                    of students studying in that field.
                                    Besides that, <span style="font-style: italic;">information technologies</span> have been slowly getting more popular over the years, rising from <span style="font-weight: bold;">5.1%</span> in 2013 to
                                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">10.3%</span> in 2023. This shows the trend of information technologies being the hot topic over the past few years. 
                                    On the other hand, the number of students studying <span style="font-style: italic;">management and commerce</span> have been slowly decreasing over the years, reaching only <span style="font-weight: bold;">15.9%</span>
                                    in 2023, which suggests that this field might be slowly eliminated.
